    "# Analysis of Student Academic Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "When we talk about student academic performance, having a good teacher or a motivated student is only a small portion of what ultimately contributes to a student’s success. There are various factors involved, some of which include parental involvement, student assessment, lesson delivery and so on. In this project, we aim at identifying the major factors that influence student academics performance.\n",

    "What are the major factors that influence student academics performance?\n",

    "## 2. Methods\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Data Preparation\n",
    "* For this research, we will use 2 datasets downloaded in csv format from UCI machine learning repository, link [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).\n",
    "* These datasets provide the performance of high school students from 2 Portuguese schools in 2 distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por)\n",
    "* Both datasets have common attributes which include student grades, demographic, social and school related features described below:\n",
