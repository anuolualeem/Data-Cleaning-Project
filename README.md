## Discovery
This research has shown that male students perform better in mathematics than female students, however female overall performance in mathematics, reading and writing is better than that of male. We also discovered that students from group E ethnicity had the best overall performance. We can't undermine the role of nutritious meals in the academic performance of student, which was evident in our research, as students who had standard lunch were seen to have the best performance. We also noticed that the education level of parents played a vital role in the performance of students. As the education level of parents increases, the overall performance of student also increases. Finally, the benefit of test preparation courses is shown in this research, as students who completed the course had better performance than those who didn't complete it.

In conclusion, we have seen how gender, race, parent education level, eating healthy meal, and test preparation courses play major roles when it comes to academic performance of students.
